1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,560
I've been getting asked a lot lately

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,639
about my thoughts about the future of

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,559
software development whenever a new AI

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,840
Advance is released I get a flood of

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,679
questions asking what is the future for

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,480
software developers and I think the

7
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:21,199
question they are not asking is will I

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,160
still be allowed to code in the future

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,080
obviously everything besides c will

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,840
still be legal I I feel like the real

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,039
question that they're asking is will I

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,000
still be able to get paid with the

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,480
skills that I'm learning while I learn

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,040
to code and so the first thing I want to

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,239
say is I hate predicting things

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,640
particularly in public if you would have

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,280
asked me 5 years ago about if any of

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,960
this AI Tech if we would have it today

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm pretty sure I would have said no and

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,359
I'm not talking about the crazy hyped up

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,800
demos I'm talking conversational AI that

22
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,920
returns some semblance of a conversation

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,440
even if it's mostly hallucinated I I I

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,840
don't think I wasn't thinking that was

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,239
going to be possible so I've had to

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,119
update my priors many times throughout

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,360
the last few years regarding Ai and its

28
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,799
capabilities and therefore it's future

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,960
capabilities as well so I just don't

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,640
have enough hubris to think that I know

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,520
what's going to happen in the future I

32
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,240
guess I do have just enough huis though

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,880
to post this video about my thoughts so

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,720
there's two major points though that I

35
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,560
want to talk about the first is that I

36
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,640
think software is more than coding and

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,640
then the second is that programming

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,240
itself is more than coding

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,040
and before I sort of go deep on those I

40
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,720
want to just seed for the sake of

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,759
argument that AI will be able to do

42
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,840
coding tasks that a junior engineer is

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,479
currently exposed to do AI will be able

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,479
to perform these as faster faster and

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,880
more cheaply than those Junior engineers

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,360
and AI will be able to do this and

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,200
productionize right sort of rolled out

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,560
to people um sometime in say the next 5

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,880
years I realize some people in my chat

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,240
keep telling me that this is going to be

51
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,079
in 6 months but that roll out SC seems

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,240
quite difficult to change the entire

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,880
structure of an industry in that time

54
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,239
but that's a conversation for a separate

55
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,000
video the reason I say that is because I

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,160
don't want to fight about what I think

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,280
the particular capabilities of AI are

58
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,239
going to be instead I want to talk about

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,720
that with sort of that scenario in mind

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,840
and if you think any of those points are

61
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,519
much too aggressive in favor of AI then

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,000
that's totally fine my argument will

63
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:30,040
just be bolstered in my in my corner the

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,640
other clarification I want to make is

65
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,160
for the rest of the video when I say

66
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,160
coding I'm sort of referring to this act

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,200
of sitting in front of a computer typing

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,440
autocom completing copying pasting a

69
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,879
programming language into an editor and

70
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,159
then shipping that to prod in some sense

71
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,360
the exclusively physical act of creating

72
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:52,080
software so when I say software is more

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,840
than coding what do I mean I'm saying

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,720
people don't pay for code they

75
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,640
definitely don't pay to just watch you

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,560
code unless you're a twitch streamer I

77
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,040
guess then people like doing that that

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,480
but what they pay for is for problems to

79
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,840
be solved and when you're coding you're

80
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,760
not getting paid for that code you're

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,480
getting paid to solve somebody else's

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,599
problems real or perceived these

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,239
problems might be for a client or they

84
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,599
could be for your boss or they could be

85
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,920
even for other software developers right

86
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,519
but the reason you're getting paid is

87
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,760
because the problem you're solving for

88
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,680
someone is valuable enough for them to

89
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,360
part with their beloved cash this boils

90
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,000
down to software being able to maybe

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,239
provide something that's faster or

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,120
cheaper or more reliable than what could

93
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,200
have been accomplished

94
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,200
previously and software is a super set

95
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,159
of just those coding tasks of just

96
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,400
literally typing into the computer

97
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,680
because you need more than just good

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,799
algorithms or a nice type system to

99
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,040
create value for your customers not to

100
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,319
say those aren't important just I'm

101
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,640
saying there is more to software than

102
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,720
that you need to be able to understand

103
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,159
requirements and update them when things

104
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,159
change this may even involve a hesitate

105
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,200
to say it talking to a client or to a

106
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,319
stakeholder you need to be able to

107
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,519
practice communication understanding the

108
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,280
non- technical aspects communicated to

109
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,360
you sometimes called listening in the

110
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,400
area of someone else's expertise and you

111
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,280
also need to be able to communicate

112
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,320
technical Concepts to non-technical

113
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,360
people in your area of expertise you

114
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,000
need to be able to say no to feature

115
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,160
creep and scope management your project

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,160
can't do everything right you need to be

117
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,800
able to say noce something you'd like to

118
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,520
do but think the cost is more than what

119
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,680
it's worth like maybe rewriting your

120
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,080
front end in Rust there's social aspects

121
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,880
to software and to making software like

122
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,039
listening to feedback and giving

123
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,840
constructive feedback there is mentoring

124
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:48,800
and being mentored there's patience

125
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,400
kindness and respect all of these things

126
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,520
create teams that are generally seeming

127
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,080
to be more effective at creating

128
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,000
software and there's also asking and

129
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,080
understanding things like how do we make

130
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,800
money at this company the best software

131
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,880
developers I've ever worked at were

132
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,880
great at all of these including coding

133
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,000
they definitely were great at writing

134
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,800
code but they understood each of these

135
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,880
and helped me to learn to do each of

136
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,039
them better all of these skills will

137
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,960
still be useful for as long as we have

138
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,199
jobs there are skills that you can

139
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,280
practice and hone while working as a

140
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,280
software developer or learning to be a

141
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,639
software developer regardless of your

142
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,360
seniority and tex

143
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,680
stack but even beyond that I want to say

144
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,479
programming itself is more than just

145
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,039
coding and maybe this section should be

146
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,400
titled something more along the lines of

147
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:46,600
programming can be a suet of coding and

148
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,960
if I'm being very reductionist and I I

149
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,199
want to be clear very reductionist I see

150
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,199
sort of two categories of programmers

151
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,160
there's solution copiers and there's

152
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,720
problem solvers solution copier is not

153
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,319
exclusively about using copypaste

154
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,000
Solutions it's about using copypaste

155
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,240
solutions for copypaste problems without

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,199
examination as a clarification there are

157
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,880
a lot of people who primarily sort of

158
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,319
copy and paste code and solve a

159
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,639
ridiculous amount of problems they could

160
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,319
be like a scrappy solo startup right and

161
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,599
they are copy pasting because they don't

162
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,120
have an engineer uh you know a legion of

163
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:24,360
Engineers to write a bunch of code they

164
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,599
need to take the solutions that are

165
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,560
available and ship quickly and iterate

166
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,680
or maybe they're a non-programmer using

167
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,199
Excel and copy basted Python scripts to

168
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,840
power some ridiculous real estate Empire

169
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,120
I don't know the point is I'm not

170
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,440
actually talking about that group of

171
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,360
people here those people are still

172
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,039
problem solvers they're just focusing on

173
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,039
a different set of problems and a

174
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:47,520
different set of solutions the solution

175
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,039
copers they're not interested in how

176
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,639
things work just getting passed to the

177
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,160
next task they're sort of unaware of the

178
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,960
ways that different libraries and

179
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,120
language and tools can solve their

180
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,120
problems or might not solve their

181
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,000
problems they just copy paste the first

182
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,120
solution from a stack Overflow problem

183
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,319
or now maybe their favorite llm until CI

184
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,599
is green there's no concept of

185
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,720
considering the context that they're

186
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,759
that they're currently in but this isn't

187
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,960
just limited to technical problems like

188
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,199
we've been talking about it might be

189
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,639
that they're not interested at all how

190
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,440
their business works or how their makes

191
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,360
money or what their customers want right

192
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,240
and maybe that they've never considered

193
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,800
does the structure of our own

194
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,720
organization help us meet the goals and

195
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,440
desires that we're setting out to do

196
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,039
in contrast we have the problem solvers

197
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,400
these are curious people who try to

198
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,400
solve problems via understanding and I

199
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,240
think these skills will remain useful

200
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,160
even if we never write a single line of

201
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,560
code

202
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,440
again and this is sort of where I think

203
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,240
people are underestimating the skills

204
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,319
that they can once again can learn via

205
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,720
software development right and my point

206
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,639
here is that it it's possible to not

207
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,199
learn these and to not practice these

208
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,479
even if you've been writing code for a

209
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,520
long time so for example I think logic

210
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,360
iCal thinking is something that we can

211
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,599
practice while we're doing software

212
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,400
development we can practice decomposing

213
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,759
large problems into smaller ones we can

214
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,440
work on recognizing iterating and

215
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,039
solving issues for customers that

216
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,479
they're actually willing to pay for you

217
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,199
can get better at domain analysis right

218
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,680
understanding a problem set possible

219
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,440
solutions and then how to implement some

220
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,240
business logic or process to solve that

221
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,720
you can work on predicting edge cases or

222
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,080
failure modes for those processes you

223
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,719
learn how to trade-off management and

224
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,640
understand that there exists tradeoffs

225
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,399
that you need to manage then there's

226
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,440
pattern recognition which is useful all

227
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,560
around us and so each of these skills

228
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,919
seem to me at least like muscles that

229
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,920
you can train and get better at you can

230
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,240
use software development as a vehicle

231
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,959
for doing that training and all of these

232
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,040
skills are going to be useful once again

233
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,440
for as long as we have jobs to do same

234
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,519
with the soft skills that I mentioned in

235
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,040
the software

236
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,160
section let me give you an example sort

237
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,040
of ill illustrate this A Tale of Two

238
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,880
neovim if you will and I know some

239
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,079
people are already going to say using

240
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,480
neovim that's just a waste of time

241
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,720
that's okay that's fine if you don't

242
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,360
like neovim that's fine but I want to

243
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,320
give a parable sort of of two different

244
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,680
people using neovim uh it's not an

245
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,640
exhaustive list just just two examples

246
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,440
so the first person tries out neovim

247
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,240
because of some extrinsic reason and

248
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
they're hurried to get to Step One of

249
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,880
using neovim they don't take time to

250
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,480
read or understand or explore something

251
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,560
breaks in their config and they just

252
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,800
post on Reddit until someone posts or

253
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,720
with solution they might make an issue

254
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,040
with no reproduction steps and we've

255
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,560
seen this kind of person in every Dev

256
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,560
community and you can probably relate in

257
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,880
my opinion this person actually is

258
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,640
wasting their time with neovim which by

259
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,600
the way is totally okay we all like to

260
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,200
waste our time in different ways I like

261
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,720
playing stard to Valley with my wife and

262
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,680
we waste time together and it's really

263
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,720
nice Pac-Man users wouldn't understand

264
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,959
however there isn't any learning going

265
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,399
on through this neovim experience which

266
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,440
is bad if it characterizes every

267
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,600
interaction that you have with skills

268
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,800
that sort of are the culmination of your

269
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,440
field compare this to someone who's

270
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,040
enjoying using neovim they learn to

271
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,240
understand how to read documentation

272
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,959
they might learn a new programming

273
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,240
language they learn new idioms and apis

274
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,160
that can teach them about software

275
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
design when something breaks in their

276
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,399
configuration they learn how to read an

277
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,680
error message I know controversial in

278
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,320
2024 they learn to debug software

279
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,320
systems they learn about rolling back

280
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,920
about lock files they may even create a

281
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,680
PR to fix a problem

282
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,680
they build solutions for themselves and

283
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,000
are able to rapidly iterate on them

284
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,279
towards something that solves a real

285
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,680
world problem for them they're their own

286
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,519
customer this person has learned a lot

287
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,399
even if they end up with exactly the

288
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:48,440
same code AS person one both people

289
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,399
spend a lot of time on neovim uh and the

290
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,680
but the first one though was a solution

291
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,959
copier and the second a problem solver

292
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,160
the skills attitudes and perspectives

293
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,680
characterizing the problem solver are

294
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,680
helpful in many of other domains even if

295
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,360
AI takes overwriting software for them

296
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,720
forever and they never get to use a

297
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,240
modal text editor again which obviously

298
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,079
would be very said in the examples I

299
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,519
gave you can replace neovim with

300
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,560
whatever technology you want react spelt

301
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,600
rust hmx Excel whatever it doesn't

302
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,000
matter the pattern and the idea is the

303
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,399
same and my ultimate Point here is that

304
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,680
you get to choose how you're going to

305
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,240
tackle problems and the takeaways you'll

306
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,480
have from actually solving that problem

307
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,440
to move from copy pter to Giga Chad

308
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,920
Problem Solver as someone in my chat put

309
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,440
it largely revolves around you deciding

310
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,160
to start thinking and asking questions

311
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,800
today and that's pretty much it then you

312
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,920
make that same Choice tomorrow and the

313
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,399
day after that and the day after that

314
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,240
and then you just keep doing that in a

315
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,120
practical example in Practical terms of

316
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,800
something you could try to do this with

317
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,200
just build something for yourself that

318
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,560
solves a real problem that you have it's

319
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,040
okay if someone else has already built

320
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,160
it the point is that you're going to

321
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,279
build it for yourself to see if you can

322
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,000
solve this problem something difficult

323
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,639
when making products for other people

324
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,240
particularly in you know large

325
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,600
businesses or with a bunch of other

326
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,040
people working on the project it's very

327
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,480
hard to distinguish good feedback from

328
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,240
loud feedback it's common to have some

329
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,440
loud feedback that seems to overwhelm

330
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,600
and outweigh all of the other feedback

331
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,480
that you are getting so the nice thing

332
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,639
about building something for yourself by

333
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,959
yourself is you get to be that loud and

334
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,240
obnoxious user and then eventually

335
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,760
you'll get to decide if you've solved

336
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,920
your problem or not and if you didn't

337
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,800
that's okay you iterate as I tell my

338
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,800
three-year-old son it's okay to fail

339
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,639
that's part of how we learn the

340
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,040
important part is that we use our

341
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,959
roughness and our toughness to try again

342
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,720
and you can translate that to any age

343
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:56,279
appropriate way of saying that for

344
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,959
you in conclusion what I want to make

345
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,000
clear though is that I'm not saying

346
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,440
solution copiers are bad people or that

347
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,920
I don't like them instead I'm trying to

348
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,560
communicate that I would be a bit more

349
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,279
concerned if all the skills that I've

350
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,519
developed revolved around regurgitating

351
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:15,320
existing solutions that to me seems an

352
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:18,040
area that is more likely to be automated

353
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,000
by AI in some fashion and more quickly

354
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,560
than other areas of software

355
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,800
development I don't like giving advice

356
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,600
on the internet mostly because life is

357
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,160
much too complicated for someone to

358
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,000
explain their situation to me and then

359
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,720
it's much too complicated for me to

360
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,320
explain my advice to them through this

361
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,839
medium so I I generally don't give

362
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,519
advice but sort of despite this advice

363
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,800
for me like be curious pay attention

364
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,040
work hard don't be afraid to fail those

365
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,320
have never really led me astray thinking

366
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,639
this way once again in my opinion right

367
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,880
gives someone the best chance at success

368
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,040
regardless of how quickly and thoroughly

369
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,240
AI expands into other software Fields I

370
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,519
don't know what the future is going to

371
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,000
look like I'm just a regular mortal I

372
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,560
put my pants on two legs at a time but I

373
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,680
do think even discounting all the

374
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,279
arguments I've made throughout the video

375
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,360
right that if your current hypothesis is

376
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,800
that billions of new lines of code are

377
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,160
going to be generated it seems likely

378
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,440
that

379
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,720
truly understanding some things about

380
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,680
code now not everything not every

381
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,240
language not every framework not every

382
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,959
type system but just some things about

383
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,800
software itself that seems to me to be a

384
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,800
beneficial skill compared to any other

385
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,480
possible skills you might have or might

386
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,320
want to learn particularly if you like

387
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,399
learning about it and you want to get

388
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,639
really good at it I hope that this can

389
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:45,440
be encouraging to you to both learn and

390
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:47,399
work hard in your software Endeavors and

391
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,160
also some confidence that maybe even if

392
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,399
we never get to write code again that a

393
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,639
lot of what we're learning can be really

394
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,759
useful and transferred to other domains

395
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,320
let me know what you think let me know

396
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:00,040
if you like the video thanks everybody I

397
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,040
love you see you later
