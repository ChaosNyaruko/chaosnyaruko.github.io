Procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity, but it can be a virtue for creativity.

Quick to start but slow to finish.

It's much easier to improve on somebody else's idea than it is to create something new from scratch.

So the lession I learned is that to be original you don't have to be first. (My thoughts: compared to FOMO, fear to missing out in recent AI waves). You just have to be different and better.

Full of doubts, having backup plans lined up.

```
the Creative Process
1. THIS IS AWESOME
2. THIS IS TRICKY
3. THIS IS CRAP 
4. I AM CRAP
5. THIS MIGHT BE OKAY
6. THIS IS AWESOME
```

Two kinds of doubt:
1. Self-doubt: paralyzing
2. Idea-doubt: energizing

Instead of step 4 ==> The first few drafts are always crap, and I'm just not there yet.

They know that in the long run, our biggest regrets are not our actions, but our inactions.

Let alone.

The more output you churn out, the more variety you get.

Sometimes it's not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed.

Embracing the fear of failing to try.
