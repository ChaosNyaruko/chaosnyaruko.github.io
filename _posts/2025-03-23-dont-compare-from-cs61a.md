# Short notes

- Freedom 
  - Think about what is worth working on, since you only have so much time. Do something matters to both the world and you)
  - Fulfilling work
    - work on something you are good at
    - you like what you are working on
    - useful to the world in some way
    - You can take some time to find it, just keep looking around
- Power
  - Don't screw it up, we are building the world
  - Create a world that lots of people can contribute to it
  - The world we have today is due to contributions of millions of people who all did their part
- Self-Worth
  - Don't compare
  - Out there in real life, how you compare to somebody else doesn't matter much at all
  - What does matter is what you are capable of, what you do, how you choose to spend your time, and what impact you have on the world.
  - It turns out your self-worth has nothing to do with what other people achieve, it has everything to do with what you achieve
  > I hope it sticks with you, and it's not a good idea to spend your time comparing yourself to other people, and just focusing on improving yourself.
