Somebody may say that configuring vim/emacs is time-consuming and even be "a waste of time".
Yes, and No.

Actually I'm not just configuring the editor, I want to figure out how things work under the hood:

My vim conf is not perfect, it just fits me, and I can tweak it as my workflow changes.
Maybe worse is better?

Using Vim/Emacs != Wasting time
