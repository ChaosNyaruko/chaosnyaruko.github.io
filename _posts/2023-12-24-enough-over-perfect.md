Many people would say that configuring vim/emacs(or some other obsession with tools) is time-consuming and even be "a waste of time". 
I quite agree with it (so I am not an Emacs guy :) ). 
> Obsession with tools is an insidious form of procrastination. This form of resistance masquerades itself as the opposite, as a form of improvement and development. 

But whether should we look for better tools? In my opinion, Yes, and No.
Yes, we should keep looking for better tools and improve our workflows, that's what tools are made for.
No, we shouldn't be "obsessed" with it, an enough tool is better than a "perfect" tool. 

Configuring/Finding tools is not just to promote our productivity, although it might be the most important purpose.
For me, actually I'm not just configuring the editor. Vim motivates me to dive into many other things. 

I start to try to figure out how things work under the hood.

I start to leverage the power of regex.

I start to try digging out how a tool/program can interact with others (fzf.vim)
- What is LSP?
- What is treesitter? Why treesitter?
- How fzf.vim works, and how can I  integrate the blazingly fast "ripgrep" into any other tools.

I start to really participate in an open source program, and read open source code, and then know better software design (extensibility: telescope, nvim-cmp)

I start to think lots of things in different ways.
- Why not tabs?
- Why not "file explorers"

I start to practice my English for better searching and discussion with others.

Agree
My vim configure is not perfect, it just suits me (or just at some time, suited me), and I can tweak it as my workflow changes.
There will never be a "perfect" tool, you can always find a better one, a new one or a tweaked one if you really know what you need.
Maybe worse is better[^2]?

# Conclusion
Using Vim/Emacs != Wasting time, but you need to strike a balance
